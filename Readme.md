## Description

This is a simple script to add smooth scroll to anchor links on your website. When a user clicks on an anchor and goes to the different page and comes back to the page where the anchor link is, the page will scroll to the anchor link smoothly.

## Installation

1. Run `npm install smooth-scroll-on-back-press` to install the package.
2. Add the following code to your JavaScript file such as `app.js` 
    
    ```javascript
    import smoothScroll from 'smooth-scroll-on-back-press';
    smoothScroll();
    ```

Now you are good to go. The script will automatically add smooth scroll to all the anchor links on your website.

## Limitations
